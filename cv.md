3. I've always been a self-taught person and loved to study: biology, history and especially languages: my first was Spanish, after several years — Hebrew, and later — Japanese. A year ago I started to think about learning programming languages and how I can apply the knowledge of them. I discovered that it was the most interesting thing and now I regret a little that I didn't find this out earlier. 
My goal is to **master my ability to program** and to understand this field in full depth. 
I think that my most strong side is the ability to solve problems on my own. I had a friend during my learning process who I could ask for help with my projects, but I needed this only a couple of times - developer console, my brain and google helped me most of the time. Now I feel confident enough to deal with tasks on the real projects. I'm eager to find a job where I can master and expand my knowledge.

7. I made a learning plan on my own and followed it for 6 months *from 5 to 10 hours a day*. I've read books (YDKJS series and many others), documentation, solved tasks on codewars and hackerRank and did my own small and big projects. 
Now I'm learning on Rolling Scopes courses just to do some *team work* and to feel myself as a part of a big community. 

8. I study and practice English all my life: read books in English (my latest was "Martin Eden" by Jack London), watch films only in original language with subtitles if necessary. I lack speaking practice now, but I'm sure I can fix this in no time! :wink:
