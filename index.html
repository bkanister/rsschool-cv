            <article class="profile-information">I’ve always been a self-taught person and loved to study: biology, history and especially languages: my first was Spanish, after several years — Hebrew, and later — Japanese. A year ago I started to think about learning programming languages and how I can apply the knowledge of them. I discovered that it was the most interesting thing and now I regret a little that I didn’t find this out earlier. My goal is to master my ability to program and to understand this field in full depth. I think that my most strong side is the ability to solve problems on my own. I had a friend during my learning process who I could ask for help with my projects, but I needed this only a couple of times - developer console, my brain and google helped me most of the time. Now I feel confident enough to deal with tasks on the real projects.
                I’m eager to find a job where I can master and expand my knowledge.
