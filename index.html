                <p>I’ve always been a self-taught person and loved to study: biology, history and especially languages: my first was Spanish, after several years — Hebrew, and later — Japanese.</p>
                <p>A year ago I started to think about learning programming languages and how I can apply the knowledge of them. I discovered that it was the most interesting thing and now I regret a little that I didn’t find this out earlier. </p>
                <p>My goal now is to master my ability to program and to understand this field in full depth.</p>
                <p>I think that my most strong side is the ability to solve problems on my own. I had a friend during my learning process who I could ask for help with my projects, but I needed this only a couple of times - developer console, my brain and google helped me most of the time. </p>
                <p>Now I feel confident enough to deal with tasks on the real projects.
                    I’m eager to find a job where I can master and expand my knowledge.</p>

                    <p>I made a learning plan on my own and followed it for 6 months from 5 to 10 hours a day.</p>
                    <p>I’ve read books (YDKJS series and many others), documentation, solved tasks on codewars and hackerRank and did my own small and big projects.</p>
                    <p>Now I’m learning on Rolling Scopes courses just to do some team work and to feel myself as a part of a big community.</p>

                    <p>I study and practice English all my life: read books in English (my latest was “Martin Eden” by Jack London), watch films only in original language with subtitles if necessary.</p>
                    <p>I lack speaking practice now, but I’m sure I can fix this in no time!</p>
